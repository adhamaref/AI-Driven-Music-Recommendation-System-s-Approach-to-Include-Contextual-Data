University of Portsmouth - Final Year Project (May 2024)

As part of my final year project for the Computer Science program, I developed an innovative AI-driven music recommendation system approach that leverages contextual data to enhance the personalization of music recommendations on Spotify. This project focused on integrating location data, user activities, and advanced music mood classification models to generate more contextually relevant music suggestions.

Key Features:
Contextual Data Integration: The system incorporates location and activity data to understand the user's environment and tailor music recommendations accordingly. 
Advanced Music Mood Classification: Utilized machine learning techniques to classify music moods, thereby improving the accuracy of recommendations based on the user's current mood and activity.
Enhanced Personalization: By combining contextual data with traditional recommendation algorithms, the system significantly improves the relevance and personalization of music recommendations compared to standard Spotify features.

This project not only allowed me to apply my technical skills in machine learning and data processing but also deepened my understanding of user-centric design and the importance of context in digital experiences. The successful implementation and positive evaluation of this system underscore the potential of contextual data in revolutionizing music recommendation services.University of Portsmouth - Final Year Project (May 2024) As part of my final year project for the Computer Science program, I developed an innovative AI-driven music recommendation system approach that leverages contextual data to enhance the personalization of music recommendations on Spotify.
